# Data-warehouse-for-a-network-of-medical-offices
A central data warehouse integrating information from various medical offices. The data warehouse schema and queries are designed for better data analysis. The data warehouse integrates data from various sources, such as offices, patients, employees, and visit information. The project includes an ERD schema of the database, an SQL file to create tables and relationships in the database, and a batch file for loading data. In the '02-hurtownia' folder, there is a 'baza.sql' file for creating the data warehouse and a 'dane.sql' file for transforming data from the database to the data warehouse. The '03-zapytania' folder contains files with queries for the database and the data warehouse for analysis and reporting.
